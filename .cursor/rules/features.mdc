# User Flow

🏁 **Onboarding** → **Dashboard** → **My Library (Hub)**

From **My Library**, user chooses:

- ✍️ **Story Builder** → **Genre** → **Character** → **Story** → **Enhancements** → **Preview & Publish** → **Preview Pages** → Back to Library

## 📄 **Preview Pages Feature**

- On the **Preview & Publish** step, users are shown a **Preview Pages** screen.
- All pages created in the story are displayed in a horizontally scrollable view.
- Users can:
  - **Select** a page to focus or highlight it.
  - **Review** the content of each page.
  - **Edit** any page directly from the preview.
  - **Add** new pages to the story.
  - **Review** the entire story flow before publishing.
- The scrollable interface allows swiping left/right to navigate through pages.
- Each page preview should be clearly labeled and accessible for editing or selection.

Other branches from the Dashboard:

- 📊 **Achievements**
- ⚙️ **Settings**
- 👨‍👩‍👧 **Parent Dashboard**

> (Optional) Consider layering in age-based genre paths (4–6, 6–8, 9–11) under the Choose Genre step to clarify how age unlocks content in the builder.
